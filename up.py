For rnv-color-mixer, derived against a fresh clone at the live head (7203617).

RNV-DELIVERY-SCRIPT-DO-NOT-SWEEP. This script is a delivery tool, not
application source, and it names what it retires. That marker is what tells
this fleet's scanners to skip it.

APPROVED 2026-10-16: "Yes we can do this", of the offer to make the tests
that look for the gold by its hex code read the accent from each app's
colour settings instead.

WHY. On 16 October the golds were swapped for the register's blues in
scratch copies of all five apps (gold-swap-trial-2026-10-16.md). Every
colour the code draws moved. Of the tests that turned red, eight did not
fail for the colour: they looked for the gold by its hex code or by its
look, found nothing, and said so. And two checks that look for a gold by
its look did not turn red at all: with a blue accent they look at nothing
and pass.

HERE. tests/test_ink_on_the_golds.py reads the golds and their inks from
utils/config.py: white on the dark gold, black on the bright gold, as ruled on 11
October, now on whatever the accent is. Its sample sheet is written from
the same names.

Nothing the application draws moves.
