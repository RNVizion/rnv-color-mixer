"""the eight-digit lower-case guard, test_eight_digit_hex_is_lower_case, for rnv-color-mixer

For rnv-color-mixer, derived against a fresh clone at the live head (dae585c).

RNV-DELIVERY-SCRIPT-DO-NOT-SWEEP. This script is a delivery tool, not
application source, and it names what it retires. That marker is what tells
this fleet's scanners to skip it.

RULED 2026-09-29: "Add the same test". The register's Notation section
(rnv-brand rev 42) records that each app's guard holds every eight-digit
value it builds or writes to lower case. Three did: the transformer, the
picker and the palette manager gained test_eight_digit_hex_is_lower_case on
2026-09-25. The color mixer was not among them. It already wrote lower case, so
nothing needed changing, and nothing held it there either. The overstatement
came from the desktop-app side's note to brand, not from brand.

This adds the same test to tests/test_derived_values.py. Nothing else moves.

The same two halves, with one difference in where the built values are found.
The other apps hold theirs at module level. This one holds none there: each
is translucent(...) where it is used. So each call is evaluated where it
stands, the one whose base is local (the harmony wash) is read from the sheet
it sets in both palettes, and the helper itself is held to lower case for
every named colour in either spelling. A new call the test cannot read fails
it until it is read.
